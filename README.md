# AnGUDev
Android Google Udacity Project work
Additional Note - AnGUDev was me figuring out whether I was going to update one repository from the "Hello World" entry
Decided to create individual repositories as I went along. 
Looking back realize that the String.xml shows the app name as AnGUDev - though this was really "Hello World"
In retrospect - at the time of the AnGUDev project creation, I should have instead called the project in Android Studio "HelloWorld".
